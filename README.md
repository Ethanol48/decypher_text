## Why does this repo exist?

I saw a [tweet](https://twitter.com/onPolygon_/status/1711035183682510921?s=20) in twitter made by Polygon and saw these binary strings and I was curius! so I thought that it was Unicodes of letters 

Repository made to cypher and de-cypher Unicode texts from and to different forms, it supports binary, regular integers and regular text
